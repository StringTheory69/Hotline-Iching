# Hotline-Iching
Call a number to get your iChing reading!

This is a fun weekend project I built for a friend. It's composed of a web scraper that scrapes a website that hosts all of the iChing and a little Twilio server. You call the number and it randomly picks a Hexagram and reads it back to you on the phone.
